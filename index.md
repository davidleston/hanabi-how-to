How to be great at Hanabi
=========================

## Introduction

Advanced players can achieve a perfect score in most games. If you do not yet know how to play Hanabi I suggest first watching one of the many [videos explaining the rules of the game](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+play+hanabi).

Becoming an advanced player involves having retrospectives between games. Retrospectives are discussions with your teammates about how the team could have done better. Photos taken during the game can help with the question "What would you have done in this situation".

During these retrospectives a collection of conventions of play develop. Conventions are agreements with your teammates about what actions mean in specific situations.

Conventions have names, advantages, disadvantages, and exceptions. Iâ€™ll demonstrate each convention from the perspective of providing information and from the perspective of receiving information.

## Basic Conventions

### Timeliness

With timeliness a clue is provided only at the time it is actionable, clues are not given for future reference.

If it's the first turn of the game and you see your teammate has the following tiles:

<hand>
  <header>Teammate's hand</header>
  <tiles>
    <tile color="yellow" rank="2"></tile>
    <tile color="blue" rank="1"><highlighted></highlighted></tile>
    <tile color="green" rank="2"></tile>
    <tile color="red" rank="4"></tile>
    <tile color="white" rank="3"></tile>
  </tiles>
</hand>

You can provide the clue "blue" and your teammate will assume it is playable and will likely play it on their next turn.

Similarly, when you are told a tile is a two, you can assume it is a playable two and you would likely want to play it on your next turn.

<hand>
  <header>Your hand</header>
  <tiles>
    <tile hidden></tile>
    <tile hidden><highlighted></highlighted></tile>
    <tile hidden></tile>
    <tile hidden><highlighted><highlighted></tile>
    <tile hidden></tile>
  </tiles>
</hand>
