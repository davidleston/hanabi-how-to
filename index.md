Advanced players can achieve a perfect score in most games. If you do not yet know how to play Hanabi I suggest first watching one of the many [videos explaining the rules of the game](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+play+hanabi).

Becoming an advanced player involves having retrospectives between games. Retrospectives are discussions with your teammates about how the team could have done better. Photos taken during the game can help with the question "What would you have done in this situation".

During these retrospectives a collection of conventions of play develop. Conventions are agreements with your teammates about what actions mean in specific situations.

Conventions have names, advantages, disadvantages, and exceptions. I’ll demonstrate each convention from the perspective of providing information and from the perspective of receiving information.

### General tips
- Prioritize getting more tiles played sooner
- Don’t worry about how many clues are left
- Don’t be afraid to discard
- Try to convey as much information in each turn

### Assumed Rules
Hanabi can be played many ways. Here are some rules I play by that others may not:
- You may only rearrange tiles when it is your turn or as the result of receiving a clue.
- Arrangement and tapping of tiles are purely confirmation of conventions. Tiles must not be arranged or tapped in such a way that information is conveyed that wouldn’t already be understood without rearrangement or tapping.
- Clues must identify at least one tile.
