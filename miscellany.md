Don’t discard on your very first turn, this means that clues on your first turn when you don’t have a playable cued up are interpreted as a forced clue.

Clueing a pair of threes before any twos have been played or a pair of fours before any threes have been played means they are duplicates. You throw one away and save the other, once you’ve thrown away the dupe you’ll know what the other tile is. Advanced convention: cluing dupes applies when there are no playable or unsafe 3s or 4s.

Do you clue before necessary in situations where it could be harder to clue later? Only when won’t be confusing. Is it appending to the chain for possible reverse? Is it pre-empting?

Five player games require a play ration better than 1:1

Two player game: assume you can discard unless maybe there are many unsafes and you can perhaps save a future playable that isn’t really needing to be saved or you’re full of clues
