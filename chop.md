title: Saving / playing the chop
order: 5
--

A number clue that includes the chop means to save all the tiles in the clue. A color clue means means the same thing as if the chop was not involved. This distinction between number and color clues only applies to clues that include the head of a chain or the chop.

### Saving multiple tiles with one clue
An early save is saving a tile before it is on the chop. A tile can be saved early by cluing a number that is both not currently playable and not clearly safe to discard. A common early save is to clue a five when there are no playable fives. Saving a tile early also saves the chop.

### Providing safe discard saves the chop
    
Another way to save the chop is to clue one or more tiles such that it’s clearly discardable. This is prioritize the discarding of these tiles and save the chop. This can be done by cluing number or color.

### Max clues to prevent discard

The rules disallow discarding when all eight clues are available. If the next player has an unsafe discard and all eight clues are available on your turn and you have a play then go ahead and play to maintain max clues on the next player’s turn. If seven clues are available and you’re about to play a five then play the five to max the clues. If seven clues are available and you can discard then discard. The exception to this last one is if your chop might be future playable and you can see that the next player’s penultimate discard is not future playable then go ahead and clue the save. They’ll discard the already played tile and you’ll have saved a potential future playable from being discarded from your chop. The reason for delaying cluing the save is because delaying might prevent the need to save.
    
There may be situations in which multiple tiles need to be saved and none of the above are options. In a games with more than two players everyone is responsible for keeping an eye out for this situation. Multiple players may need to clue a player before their next turn. This means you’re looking at more than just the next player’s chop. If a you receive a save clue from two players before you in turn order and the interim player doesn’t have a play queued nor has a useful clue to give then assume the interim player is going to give you another save clue and save one more tile in from the chop than you normally would.
    
Clueing to play a tile that results in a bomb means save two from the from the chop. You can clue to play a tile that the player already knows to be unplayable and they will save two on the chop without actually playing. (Doesn't work if it's a forced clue)
    
Discarding / playing a tile that isn't expected tells the other player to save that many tiles. This is very unsafe and should only be used when absolutely necessary such as needing to save more than two tiles or needing to save tiles without clues. If the situation allows play instead of discarding because you might get lucky and actually get a valid play.
