title: Finesse and bluff
order: 6
---

Finessing and bluffing only works with three or more players.

- only bluff one up
- Forces intermediate player to play
- Cannot bluff on a forced rainbow, a forced rainbow is always a finesse.
- Reverse finesse and reverse bluff requires convention that clueing additional tiles appends to the chain either always or when itâ€™s a possible reverse finesse/bluff.
