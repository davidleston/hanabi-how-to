title: Chaining / clueing multiple tiles
order: 4
---

When multiple tiles are clued the tiles are played from right to left. The collection tiles queued up for play is called the chain.

### Turning off chains

Whenever a clue includes the head of a chain the entire chain is saved (no longer queued for play, no longer in the line of succession).

### Playing through a chain being turned off

If such a clue is a color clue and the only tile in the chain clued is the head and there are other tiles not in the chain included in the clue, then the other tiles are queued up. This is called playing through the clue. Otherwise any tiles included in a clue to the head of the chain are also saved. The distinction between number and color clues only applies to clues that include the head of a chain or the chop (discussed later).

### Reordering a chain

A clue that contains one or more tiles in a chain (but not the head of the chain) moves those tiles to the head of the chain. The tiles that are moved to the head of the chain maintain their order. Any tiles included in the clue that were not in the chain are saved.

### Alternative to chaining

A team may decide to play a game with chaining off. The decision to play with chaining on or off is made before the game begins. When chaining is off the rightmost tile in a multi-tile clue is queued for play and the other tiles are saved.
