title: Forced clues and being locked up
order: 8
---

If all your tiles are saved discard any tiles you know to be safe such as a two that was saved early.

If you don't know any tiles to be safe or you have no plays and full clues then you must give a forced clue. Forced clues should be interpreted differently than unforced clues:

- Clueing a tile that is known to be unsafe to play does not mean to save tiles on the chop, it's just burning a clue to allow churn. 
- Clueing safe discards does not mean save the chop though safe discards should be prioritized. 
- A clue of anything that might be interpreted as a play clue otherwise is a play clue.
- First clue plays. If you cannot clue a play try to provide more information about saved tiles without saving unnecessary tiles or accidentally clueing a play. Balance with saving/delaying tiles that will unlock you. Then priories safe discards over future playables. As a last resort: spin. A common spin clue is “fives are fives”. 
- Clueing a playable and safe discard allows the other player to decide to play which if out of clues tells you what you have.
