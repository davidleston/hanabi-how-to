title: Out of clues
order: 7
---

When you've run out of clues assess if the next player requires immediate information. If they do not, then play if you have a play otherwise discard.

If the next player is about to play a safe to discard but unplayable tile and there are spare bombs then let the player bomb.

The next player requires information when:

- They are about to discard an unsafe tile
- They are about to play an unsafe and unplayable tile
- They are about to splay a safe unplayable tile and there are already two bombs

The key is to do something you would not normally do in order to signal to the next person you don’t want them to do what they’d normally do. You’ll be in one of three positions:

- You have a tile queued for play and a known safe discard. This is the best scenario. Go ahead and discard your safe discard.
- You have a tile queued for play but no known discard. Discard anyway despite the risk of discarding an unsafe tile.
- You have no tiles queued for play. Play your chop. It's almost certainly a bomb otherwise it would have been saved. If you already have two bombs then discard one in from the chop as it's the oldest and therefore safest to discard.

When playing with more than two players keep an eye out for when the next player needs a clue to clue the player after them. If you're out of clues in this scenario and you would otherwise play then discard in these scenarious:
- If you have a known safe discard
- If there are already two bombs
- If the next player's chop is unsafe and unplayable

Otherwise go ahead and leave the next player with the options listed above.
